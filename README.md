The Canary Server is a free and open-source MMORPG server emulator written in C++. It is a fork of the optimized version of [OpenTibia Server](https://github.com/SaiyansKing/optimized_forgottenserver) project, made by [SaiyansKing](https://github.com/SaiyansKing). To connect to the server, you can use [OTClient](https://github.com/opentibiabr/otclient/tree/canary).
